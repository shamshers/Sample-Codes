Using SoapUI for API load testing instead of ReadyAPI might present a few challenges:

1. **Limited Features**: SoapUI, while capable of conducting API functional testing, may lack some advanced features specifically designed for load testing that are available in ReadyAPI.

2. **Scalability**: ReadyAPI is designed with scalability in mind, making it more suitable for handling large-scale load tests involving hundreds or thousands of virtual users. SoapUI may not be as efficient in managing such high loads.

3. **Performance**: ReadyAPI is optimized for performance testing, offering features like distributed load testing and real-time performance monitoring, which SoapUI may not provide or may have limited functionality in.

4. **Ease of Use**: ReadyAPI typically offers a more user-friendly interface and streamlined workflows for setting up and running load tests compared to SoapUI, which may requi more manual configuration and scripting.

5. **Reporting**: ReadyAPI often provides more comprehensive and customizable reporting options for load test results, allowing for better analysis and interpretation of performance metrics compared to SoapUI.

Overall, while it's possible to perform API load testing using SoapUI, using ReadyAPI may offer a more robust and efficient solution, especially for complex or high-volume load testing scenarios.
